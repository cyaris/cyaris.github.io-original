Can topic modeling teach us about the subject matter of Nostradamusâ€™s prophecies? This is the question I sought to answer by applying natural language processing to an almost 500 year-old document, Nostradmus's ["Les Propheties."](https://www.sacred-texts.com/nos/index.htm){:target="_blank"} Since its publication in 1555, the 942 quatrains of Nostradamus's most famous work have been re-applied to infamous events in every century since. From the rise of Hitler, to the attacks of September 11th, "Les Propheties" has solidified its legacy by finding new supporters in each generation who are willing to bet that Nostradamus predicted a given tragedy decades hundreds of years before it occurred.

While it's understood that Nostradamus's predictions were filled with impending doom for various kings, and kingdoms *(and debatably modern civilizations as well)* I wanted to parse through the doom and to get a deeper understanding for the types of negative events Nostradamus was predicting.

Using Truncated SVD with a TF-IDF vectorizer, I separated "Les Propheties" into three distinct topics. I found that TF-IDF worked better than a count vectorizer because *(as you can see from the chart below)*, Nostradamus repeats very few works in his prophecies.
