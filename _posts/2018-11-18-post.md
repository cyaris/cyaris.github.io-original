Can topic modeling teach us about the subject matter of Nostradamusâ€™s prophecies? This is the question I sought to answer by applying natural language processing to an almost 500 year-old document, Nostradmus's ["Les Propheties."](https://www.sacred-texts.com/nos/index.htm){:target="_blank"} Since its publication in 1555, the 942 quatrains of Nostradamus's most famous work have been re-applied to infamous events in every century since. From the rise of Hitler, to the attacks of September 11th, "Les Propheties" has solidified its legacy by finding new supporters in each generation who are willing to bet that Nostradamus predicted a given tragedy decades hundreds of years before it occurred.

While it's understood that Nostradamus's predictions were filled with impending doom for various kings, and kingdoms *(and debatably modern civilizations as well)*, I wanted to parse through the doom and get a deeper understanding for the types of negative events Nostradamus was predicting.

*The visualization below shows that the word "Nostradamus" has had a higher Google search volume than "prophecy" itself during several periods since 2004.*

Using truncated SVD with a TF-IDF vectorizer, I reduced the 770 words of "Les Propheties" into three distinct topics. A TF-IDF worked well with this corpus because Nostradamus repeats very few words in his prophecies.

*The chart below depicts the top words used in "Les Propheties." Across all 942 prophecies, only one word is used in more than 15% of the prophecies.*

* Topic  1: Doom to a Kingdom by War/Attack
  * great, die, come, king, land, near, bleed, sea, people, long

* Topic  2: Conspiracy Against the King
  * die, king, time, bleed, long, realm, year, capture, life, conspirator

* Topic  3: Doom to a Kingdom by Nature
  * land, die, sea, bleed, fleet, near, water, sudden, far, tremble

At this point, for each prophecy I had three separate weights, which corresponded to the three distinct topics. To visualize the distribution of these 3 topics, I went through each prophecy and identified the topic with the maximum weight. The topic with the maximum weight for each prophecy would determine its color in the visualization. Then, I used principal component analysis to reduce the dataset of weights from three dimensions to two dimensions.

*The visualization below shows this distribution of topics across all 942 prophecies, with the topic that received the maximum weight determining the color for a given prophecy.*
