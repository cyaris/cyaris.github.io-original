Can topic modeling teach us about the subject matter of Nostradamusâ€™s prophecies? This is the question I sought to answer by applying natural language processing to an almost 500 year-old document, Nostradmus's "Les Propheties." Since its publication, the 942 quatrains in Nostradamus's most famous work have been re-applied to major infamous events in every century. From the rise of Hitler, to the attacks of September 11th, "Les Propheties" has solidified its legacy by finding new supporters each generation who are willing to bet that Nostradamus predicted a given tragedy decades, (or more accurately today), hundreds of years earlier.
