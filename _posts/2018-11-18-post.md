Can topic modeling teach us about the subject matter of Nostradamus’s prophecies? This is the question I sought to answer by applying natural language processing to an almost 500 year-old document, Nostradmus's ["Les Propheties."](https://www.sacred-texts.com/nos/index.htm){:target="_blank"} Since its publication in 1555, the 942 quatrains of Nostradamus's most famous work have been re-applied to infamous events in every century since. From the rise of Hitler, to the attacks of September 11th, "Les Propheties" has solidified its legacy by finding new supporters in each generation who are willing to bet that Nostradamus predicted a given tragedy decades hundreds of years before it occurred.

While it's understood that Nostradamus's predictions were filled with impending doom for various kings, and kingdoms *(and debatably modern civilizations as well)*, I wanted to parse through the doom and get a deeper understanding for the types of negative events Nostradamus was predicting.

*The visualization below shows that the word "Nostradamus" has had more search volume than "prophecy" itself during several periods since 2004.*

Using Truncated SVD with a TF-IDF vectorizer, I separated "Les Propheties" into three distinct topics. I found that TF-IDF worked well with this corpus because Nostradamus repeats very few words in his prophecies.

*The chart below depicts the top words used in "Les Propheties." Across all 942 prophecies, only one word is used in more than 15% of the prophecies.*
