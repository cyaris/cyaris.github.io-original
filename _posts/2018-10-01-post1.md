**The Solution is Right in Front of You**
<br>
*Take a break and come back later...*

Last week I began studying as a full-time student in Metis’ data science bootcamp. Following a review in exploratory data analysis, I worked throughout the week with my new classmates on our first project, which analyzed MTA turnstile data. I had learned web scraping with scrapy before the course, so when we determining our individual roles, I excitedly told my two group members (Gabe and Jake) that scraping our data from the web would be "no problem at all." Soon, this task would remind me of a very valuable coding lesson.

I once had a hitting coach who before and after every lesson would tell his players, "The ball is an excellent teacher." While a baseball's trajectory is 100% dependent on how it made contact with the bat, the success of code can also be observed instantaneously by how the computer responds according to the instructions. When those instructions are conflicting or insufficient, we get error messages. Addressing some errors is hard, while addressing others is easy. Like most others, I often resort to StackOverflow when an error message proves frustrating to see if anybody has had a similar issue. Too often though, I find that I had resorted to StackOverflow too quickly in realizing that the cause of the error was right in front of me all along.

That is exactly what I did when the spider I built to scrape the MTA website repeatedly crawled 0 pages. After repeated troubleshooting and a little bit of moaning, I became tempted to blame the computer and proclaim the error to be a complete and utter mistake. I tried editing my settings so that my spider would allow certain error messages. When that didn't work, I thought I must need a proxy to scrape the data without getting blocked. The longer I stared at my code, the more right it seemed, at which point I begrudgingly allowed myself to go to sleep.

The following day I told my group members all about the pesty error message, and while explaining the issue to them, I found the mistake in my code that I hadn't seen myself after hours of pointless staring. For error there at least one solution. This particular solution was simple, and right in front of me. It was a great reminder to be patient with my progress, and to come back to an issue later if I can't find a solution.

**MTA Turnstile Insights**

The objective of our analysis was to provide a recommendation for where a women in tech organization should place their volunteers in promoting their upcoming summer gala. With the gala set for a date in the beginning of the summer, my group decided to narrow our analysis to May, June and July of the last two years. We created several dataframes for our analysis, grouping the data entries at both the turnstile and the station level, as well as by time, date and month.

For each dataframe, we made the statistic of average passengers per hour a primary focus of our analysis. Our reasosn for this were that in maximizing overall impressions for the volunteers, they could maximize their conversion rate for promotion. In order to make sure that the volunteers would find commuters likely to attend/donate, we identified several priority stations for their proximity to tech companies in the city. As the gala was to be in the Lower East Side of NYC, we also priority stations that would provide a convenient route to the venue. The total number of priority stations amounted to 18. In sorting the top subway stations by overall passengers per hour across those six months (May, June and July for 2017, 2018), we found that six of our 18 priority stations made the cut into the top 40 and can be seen in orange in this visualization.

The top three of our priority stations for overall passengers per hour were 14 ST, 14 ST UNION-SQ and 23 ST. These were placed 2nd, 7th, and 11th for the city overall. Since all three were quite high in the overall rank for the city, we felt confident in focusing entirely on these three stations for the remainder of our analysis.

The visualization below depicts passengers per hour by day of week for 14 ST, 14 ST UNION-SQ and 23 ST. While 14 ST is 1st, 14 ST UNION-SQ is 2nd and 23 ST is 3rd for every day of the week, the distributions appear to be relatively consistent between Monday-Friday, and lower on Saturday and Sunday. As a result, our recommendation suggested promotion during the week only, with no preference for a particular day Monday-Friday..

The visualization below depicts passengers per hour by hours of the day for 14 ST, 14 ST UNION-SQ and 23 ST. Like the visualization above, 14 ST is 1st, 14 ST UNION-SQ is 2nd and 23 ST is 3rd for every hour of the day. The window from 5:00pm–8:00pm though appears to have the largest values across all three stations. As a result, our recommendation suggested this particular window for promotion.
