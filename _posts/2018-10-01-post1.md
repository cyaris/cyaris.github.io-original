**The Solution is Right in Front of You**
*Take a break and come back later.*

Last week I began studying as a full-time student in Metisâ€™ data science bootcamp. Following a review in exploratory data analysis, I worked throughout the week with my new classmates on our first project, which analyzed MTA turnstile data. I had learned web scraping with scrapy before the course, so when we determining our individual roles, I excitedly told my two group members that obtaining our data from the web would be "no problem at all." Soon, this task would remind me of a very valuable coding lesson.

I once had a hitting coach who before and after every lesson would tell his players, "The ball is an excellent teacher." It's trajectory is 100% dependent on how it made contact with the bat. Similarly, code is just a group of instructions for computers to interpret and respond to accordingly. When those instructions are conflicting or insufficient, we get error messages. Addressing some errors is hard, and others, easy. I often deal with the more frustrating error messages by visiting StackOverflow to see if anybody has had a similar issue. When troubleshooting doesn't work after repeated attempts and a little bit of moaning, it can be tempting to blame the computer and proclaim that the error message must be a mistake.

That is exactly what I did when the spider I built to scrape the MTA website repeatedly crawled 0 pages. I tried editing my settings so that my spider would allow certain error messages. When that didn't work, I thought I must need a proxy to scrape the data without getting blocked. The longer I stared at my code, the more right it seemed, at which point I begrudgingly allowed myself to go to sleep.

The following day I told my group members all about the pesty error message, and while explaining the issue to them, I found the mistake in my code that I hadn't seen myself after hours of pointless staring. For error there at least one solution. This particular solution was simple, and right in front of me. It was a great reminder to be patient with my progress, and to come back to an issue later if I can't find a solution.

**MTA Turnstile Insights**

The objective of our analysis was to provide a recommendation for where a women in tech organization should place their volunteers in promoting their upcoming summer gala. With the gala set for a date in the beginning of the summer, we decided to narrow our analysis to May, June and July of the last two years. We created several dataframes for our analysis, grouping the data entries at both the turnstile and the station level, as well as by time, date and month.
