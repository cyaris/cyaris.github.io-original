My most recent data science project entailed using court sentencing data to predict whether a defendant plead guilty, or was found guilty by a jury at trial. By total coincidence, the dataset I used was entirely on guilty sentences from the county in which I live, Cook County, IL. While I thought predicting the conviction type of a particular case would provide insight into the power of plea bargaining, I had no idea that it was also closely tied to a long-standing controversy within the US justice system.

Upon speaking with a close friend about my project, I was pointed in the direction toward [a Chicago Tribune article](https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1985-10-13-8503090729-story.html) on "jury tariffs," a concept which refers to the price defendants pay in increased sentences when they take their case to trial instead of pleading guilty. We expect the same penalty for the same crimes, but jury tariffs suggests that this is not the case. According to one anonymous Cook County Judge quoted in the Chicago Tribune article, "Not having a jury trial can save a lot of time and effort. Pragmatically speaking, it’s necessary and it’s justified to give a guy a tougher sentence if he takes more time and burdens the system." (Tybor, Joseph R. & Eissman, Mark. "JUDGES PENALIZE THE GUILTY FOR EXERCISING RIGHT TO JURY TRIAL." *Chicago Tribune,* 13 October 1985') While some may find this judge's opinion to be logical in trying to keep the justice system from becoming backlogged with too many cases, the reality (*stated in the Chicago Tribune article*) is that "The Illinois Supreme Court has ruled on several occasions that the accused cannot be punished for electing to have his case decided by a jury."

I soon realized, if while only using features that would be known at the start of a new case, I was able to predict the conviction type from a sentence, that I would be providing supporting evidence for the use of jury tariffs in Cook County.
